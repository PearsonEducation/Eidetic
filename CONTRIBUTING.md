# Contributing to Eidetic

:wave: Thank you for taking time to contribute to Eidetic :wave:

Below you will find guidelines regarding how to contribute to this branch of Eidetic, originally a [PearsonEducation OSS (Open Source Software) product](https://github.com/PearsonEducation/Eidetic), and now a continued endeavor of modernization and exercise in software redesign. I believe guidelines are a decent way of working as a group. Use your best judgment when reviewing, and if you have suggestions, please feel free to make a pull request (PR).
